# ISO

- What is a computer network
  - its a communication between two or more network interfaces
  - like wireless or wired connections
- Components needed to communicate
- Two or more devices
- cables as links or wireless
- A netwoek interface card(NIC) on each
- Computer
- Swtiches to connect multiple netwrok togfether
- routers to route the requests
- software also known as operating system (OS)

## How do they communicate

### OSI model

- People aroud the world uses computer network to communicate with each other
- For worldwide data communication systems must be developed which are compitable to communicate with each other
- there should be standardcommunication methods & devices
- ISO ( International Organization of Stanmndard ) has developed this standard
- its kindof a language the OSI
- so ISO has developer the OSI
- its 7 layers

  1. Application (browsers)
  2. Data link (cables)

- The basic elements of a layered model are
  - services
  - protocols
  - and interfaces
  1.  A service is a set of actions that a layer offers to another layer
  2.  A protocol is a set of rules that a layer users to exchange information
  3.  A interface means communication between two letters

### Physical layer

- iformation is in bits and send this to datalink layer

## Classification of Network by geography

- LAN (local area network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network like internet)
- MAN (metropolitian area network)
- CAN (Campus area network like office internet)

## Devices

- Swtiches facilitate the sharing of resources by connecting together all the devices includng computers , printers and servers in a small business network

## ROuters

- A router and sends data on computer networks . ROuters are sometimes confused with network hubs , modems or network switches . However routers cab combine Multiple networks together
- Example is CAN

## IPv4 Address

- 32 bit binary number
- public IP (Internet IP)
- Private IP (lets )
